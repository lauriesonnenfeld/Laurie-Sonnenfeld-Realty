# Laurie-Sonnenfeld-Realty
I started in real estate 27 years ago. Over the years I have noticed that a lot of people are thrilled to have the help and guidance of an experienced realtor who shares their Portland style values including protecting the natural environment, building cohesive community, strengthening neighborhoods, and respecting the worth and integrity of older homes. Their main goal is to buy or sell their home,but they want a good experience too. That includes having a comfortable, warm working relationship with a down-to-earth person who can help them navigate successfully towards their dreams and goals. So many years later, I’m still enjoying this work, and I’m still learning.
